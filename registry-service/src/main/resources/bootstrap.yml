#This file is the entrypoint for spring to know where to look for the configuration file and hold the initial configuration
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      name: registry-service
      uri: http://localhost:8000 #where the config-service is running
      password: 1234 #password of the config-service
      username: user #username of the config-service

eureka:
  instance:
    prefer-ip-address: true #when the application registers with eureka, it uses its IP address rather than its hostname
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false #tells the built-in eureka client to not register itself with eureka, because we should act as a server
    fetchRegistry: false
